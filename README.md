# NUSMods-Plus

A Chrome extension for saving session data on <https://nusmods.com/>. Take your module timetable that you spent so long optimising with you on any Chrome browser. Simple save and load the session data which will be synced using your NUSNET ID.

**Notice**: The extension is currently under development and maybe buggy at times. But if you like the idea and want to contribute, do hit me up!

## Setup Guide

1. Download the extension <a href="https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/danielk0k/NUSMods-Plus/tree/main/version2/build/chrome-mv3-prod" target="_blank">here</a>
2. Unzip the folder named `chrome-mv3-prod`
3. Open your browser and navigate to extensions under settings
4. Switch to **developer mode**
5. Click on `Load unpacked` and select the folder

## Motivation

I got frustrated whenever I cleared my browsing data and realised that I accidentally also cleared all data from my timetable planning on NUSMods. This means spending another 10mins trying to recall how my timetable was like before I nuked it and putting it back again. Hence, the idea for NUSMods Plus came to life. Not only can I clear my browsing data in peace, I can also bring my timetable with me to any browser I'm logged onto.
