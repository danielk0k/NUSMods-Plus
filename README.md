A Chrome extension for saving session data on <https://nusmods.com/>. Take your module timetable that you spent so long optimising with you on any Chrome browser. Simple save and load the session data which will be synced with your Google account.

**Notice**: The extension is currently under development and maybe buggy at times. But if you like the idea and want to contribute, do hit me up!

## Motivation

I got frustrated whenever I cleared my browsing data and realised that I accidentally also cleared all data from my timetable planning on NUSMods. This means spending another 10mins trying to recall how my timetable was like before I nuked it and putting it back again. Hence, the idea for NUSMods Plus came to life. Not only can I clear my browsing data in peace, I can also bring my timetable with me to any browser I'm logged onto.

## Reference

Much of the code was referenced to Google's [extension documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/).
